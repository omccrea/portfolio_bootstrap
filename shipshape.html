        In practice, I found this "perfect" structure to be difficult to nail down. I started by creating a set of notecards listing a selection of resources, and asked three people to group them. All three individuals separated the items by their type, but also commented that they could see grouping by topic to be useful.

				In response, I worked out a user flow that could be searched by both category and topic - inspired by blog design-patterns. The most inclusive categories were item types, so they became categories, and topics were assigned as tags.

				The most successful layout featured breadcrumbs and links integrated into titles.
